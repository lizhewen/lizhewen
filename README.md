I'm a technology enthusiast based in NYC. I'm currently pursuing master's degrees from [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) of Cornell University and Technion via [Jacobs Institute](https://tech.cornell.edu/jacobs-technion-cornell-institute/). I hold a Bachelor degree in Computer Science from [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/). My interests include Machine Learning, Data Visualizations, and User-Centered Software Development.
